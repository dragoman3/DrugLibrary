## What is Propofol?
- Alkylphenol derivative that provides sedative effects

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Entirety of the mechanism is poorly understood, however it has an agonistic effect on the GABA receptors of the central nervous system 
- With agonistic effects on GABA, it will potentiate the inhibitory effect, increasing chloride conductance across the neuron making it harder for an action potential to fire 
- It is a highly protein bound and lipophilic drug, it is metabolized in the liver through conjugation and excreted primarily through the renal system

## Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2] 
#### Cardiovascular 
- Decrease arterial blood pressure by dropping systemic vascular resistance via arterial and venous vasodilation
- Reduction in preload, afterload and cardiac output
- Inhibits baroreceptor response so which prevents the physiologic heart rate response to hypotension 

#### Respiratory
- Decreases respiratory drive
- Inhibits hypoxia mediated drive to breathe
- Reduced ventilatory response to elevated carbon dioxide levels 
- Suppress upper airway reflexes
- Decreases tidal volume while increasing respiratory rate thereby having minimal effect on overall minute ventilation 

#### Central Nervous System
- Decreases cerebral metabolic rate
- Decreases cerebral blood flow
- Decreases intracranial pressure
- Decreases intraocular pressure 
- Has anticonvulsant properties 

## Indications [^1]
#### Anesthetic Indications
- Induction of general anesthesia 
- Maintenance of general anesthesia (total intravenous anesthetic technique)
- Sedation during procedures or other clinical indications (i.e. mechanical ventilation, intubation)

#### Other Indications 
- Treatment of refractory seizures
- Treatment of refractory postoperative nausea and vomiting 

## Dosage [^2]
- Induction doses are 1.5 - 2.5 mg/kg IV with typical dosing being 2.5 mg/kg for healthy non-premedicated adults, there is a dose reduction to 1 - 2 mg/kg in patients who are premedicated with opioids and benzodiazepines  
- Maintenance doses are 20 - 200 Âµg/kg/min
- Half-life of redistribution = 2 - 8 minutes
- Half-life of elimination = 4 - 7 hours

## Complications [^1] [^2]
- Burning and pain upon injection is common in patients, some Anesthetists co-administer propofol with lidocaine which can mitigate this effect
- Allergic reaction to specific proteins that make up the lipid emulsion 
- Fever, chills and sepsis secondary to contaminated lipid emulsions 
- Hypotension 
- QT prolongation, however this is a rare adverse effect
- Can cross the placenta in pregnant patients an can lead to neonatal CNS and respiratory depression, however compared to other induction agents, propofol has the safest drug profile to be used in obstetrical patients 
- Should be used with caution in patients with reduced cardiovascular reserve or fixed cardiac output due to its cardiovascular effects 
- Propofol infusion syndrome is a rare but fatal side effect often seen with prolonged infusion. Signs include refractory bradycardia, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipidemia, renal and cardiac failure.
