## What is RSI? [^1]
- General anesthesia usually involves impairment of airway reflexes, thereby increasing aspiration risk
- If patients who require general anesthesia are at a higher risk of gastric aspiration during the perioperative phase, rapid sequence induction can be performed to reduce risk of aspiration
- RSI entails advanced airway techniques, use of pharmacology knowledge and intubation to safely induce general anesthesia
- Planning and preparation ahead of performing the technique is crucial for safety

## Indications [^1]
#### Patients with predisposed risk factors for aspiration including:
1. aLOC - substances, TBI, shock, trauma
2. Impaired airway reflexes - aLOC, prolonged intubation, local airway anesthesia, CVA
3. Increased intragastric pressure - full stomach, bowel obstruction, obesity, pregnancy
4. Delayed gastric emptying - medications, narcotics, pregnancy, diabetes (neuropathy)

## Steps for RSI [^1]
1. Preoxygenation - increases reserve prior to induction, paralysis and intubation as it allows for longer periods of apnea 
2. Cricoid pressure - sustained until the airway is secured with an ETT, this prevents gastric contents from entering the airway
3. Administer IV anesthetics and muscle relaxants - neuromuscular blockade achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium, most common induction agent is propofol, can also use other agents such as opioids (fentanyl), benzodiazepine (midazolam), lidocaine
4. Endotracheal intubation - inflated cuff is crucial, preparation ensures proper placement with the first attempt
5. Confirmation of ETT placement - visualization of the tube passing between the vocal cords, chest rise, EtCO2, auscultation for bilateral equal breath sounds
#### Modified RSI:
- Some clinicians do not opt to apply cricoid pressure as it has sometimes observed to be ineffective
- Although BMV is avoided in patients undergoing RSI, if they are at risk of rapid desaturation then they may benefit from BMV.
