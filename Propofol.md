## What is Propofol? [^1][^2]
- Alkylphenol derivative providing sedative effects for induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
- Rapid redistribution allows brief, deep sedation (e.g., joint reductions, cardioversions, ECT).

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it primarily exerts effects via agonism of the GABA receptors in the CNS.
- Potentiates the inhibitory effect of GABA, increasing chloride conductance across neurons, making it harder for an action potential to fire.
- Highly protein-bound and lipophilic, metabolized in the liver via conjugation, and excreted through the renal system.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1][^2]
### Cardiovascular
- Decreases arterial blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance through arterial and venous vasodilation.
- Reduces preload, afterload, and cardiac output.
- Inhibits the baroreceptor response, preventing the compensatory increase in heart rate typically seen with hypotension.

### Respiratory
- Depresses respiratory drive, leading to apnea in approximately 1 in 4 patients.
- Inhibits hypoxia-mediated drive to breathe and reduces the ventilatory response to elevated CO2.
- Suppresses upper airway reflexes, facilitating tracheal intubation and LMA placement.
- Decreases tidal volume while increasing respiratory rate, with minimal impact on minute ventilation.

### Central Nervous System
- Decreases cerebral metabolic rate (CMR), cerebral blood flow (CBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), and intraocular pressure (IOP).
- Exhibits anticonvulsant properties and can be used in the treatment of refractory seizures.

## Indications [^1][^2]
### Anesthetic Indications
- Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia (TIVA technique).
- Sedation during procedures (e.g., mechanical ventilation, intubation).

### Other Indications
- Treatment of refractory seizures.
- Treatment of refractory postoperative nausea and vomiting.

## Dosage [^2]
- **Induction Dose:** 1.5 - 2.5 mg/kg IV; reduced to 1 - 2 mg/kg in patients premedicated with opioids or benzodiazepines.
- **Maintenance Dose:** 20 - 200 Âµg/kg/min IV infusion. See TIVA.
- **Half-life:** Redistribution: 2 - 8 minutes; Elimination: 4 - 7 hours.

## Complications [^1][^2]
- Pain on injection, often mitigated by co-administration of lidocaine.
- Hypotension, particularly in patients with reduced cardiovascular reserve or fixed cardiac output.
- Propofol infusion syndrome (rare but fatal): characterized by refractory bradycardia, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipidemia, renal and cardiac failure.
- Risk of infection from contaminated lipid emulsions.
- QT prolongation (rare).
- Crosses the placenta, potentially causing neonatal CNS and respiratory depression, but considered relatively safe for obstetrical use.
- Should be used with caution in patients with compromised cardiovascular function.
