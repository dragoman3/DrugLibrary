## Mechanism of Action [^1]
- Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic with both indirect and direct effects on catecholamine receptors:
	- **Indirect**: promotes the release of endogenous norepinephrine which acts on alpha and beta receptors
	- **Direct**: partial activity on alpha and beta receptors contributes to its activity
- Overall, a bolus of ephedrine will raise the blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output of a patient. It is less potent than other vasopressors but acts slightly longer

## Indications [^1]
- **Hypotension in anesthesia**: Used for treatment of intraoperative hypotension, especially when caused by spinal or epidural anesthesia.
- **Nasal decongestion**: Historically used as a decongestant.

## Dosage [^1]
- **Hypotension Management (IV):**
  - Adults: 5-10 mg IV bolus, may repeat every 3-5 minutes as needed.
  - Pediatrics: 0.1 mg/kg IV, may repeat as needed.
- **Intramuscular**: 25-50 mg for mild hypotension

## Complications [^1]
- **Tachycardia**: Due to β1 receptor stimulation.
- **Hypertension**: Prolonged use or high doses may lead to excessive vasoconstriction.
- **Tolerance**: Repeated doses may lead to tachyphylaxis (decreased response).

## Pharmacokinetics [^1]
- **Onset of Action:** Rapid, typically within minutes when administered IV.
- **Duration:** Short, lasting about 10-15 minutes IV.
- **Metabolism:** Partially hepatic, with some unmetabolized drug excreted unchanged in the urine.
- **Elimination Half-life:** Approximately 3-6 hours.
