# What is Ketamine?
- Rapidly acting nonbarbiturate drug used for general anesthetic providing a dissociative effect and sedation. It can also lead to hallucinations. 

# Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Ketamine acts in a *noncompetitive* antagonistic mechanism of the NMDA receptor,
	- inhibits excitation of nerves
- Secondary effects at the opiate, muscarinic, cholinergic and serotonergic receptors 
- Ketamine is a highly lipid soluble drug and is metabolized in the liver via demethylation and hydroxylation pathways. It is eliminated via the gastrointestinal tract and renal system in its metabolite forms. 


# Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2] [^3]
## Cardiovascular 
- Inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. 
	- Transient increase in HR, BP, SVR
	- Can lead to increased coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen demand. 

## Respiratory
- Minimal impact on respiratory drive & minute ventilation 
- airway reflexes preserved -> large doses can lead to impaired airway
- Produces  bronchodilation 
- Increased airway secretions

## Central Nervous System
- Increases cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow thereby increasing cerebral vasodilation 
- Cataleptic state without amnesia can occur without amnesia can be quite distressing
	- hallucinations, delirium, dissociative state can all occur
- Anticonvulsant properties  
- Increased tone which can manifest as myoclonic contraction and vocalization 

# Indications [^3]
## Anesthetic Indications
- Induction of general anesthesia 
- Short term sedation and analgesia during procedures or other clinical indications 

## Other Indications 
- Pain management (generally infused)
- Bronchodilatory properties for patients with bronchospasm
- Treatment of refractory depression and suicidal ideation 
- Widely used in the emergency department in short cases requiring short term anesthetic, such as fracture reductions 

# Dosing [^2]
- Induction doses are 0.5 - 2 mg/kg IV or 3-5 mg/kg IM 
- Analgesia doses are 0.15 - 0.25 mg/kg IV
- Half-life of redistribution = 11 - 16 minutes
- Half-life of elimination = 2 - 4 hours 

# Complications  [^2] [^3]
- dysphoria at intermediate dosing can be profound
	- analgesic doses generally tolerated well, high doses lead to complete sedation
- Most commonly, patients can experience nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and confusion 
- Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis
- Increased muscular tone with myoclonic contractions resembling seizures 
- Use with caution in cardiac disease due to stimulatory effects
