## What is Norepinephrine? [^1]
- Norepinephrine is produced endogenously and is one of the main neurotransmitters of the sympathetic nervous system
- Norepinephrine is used as a vasopressor in many clinical scenarios and can be given as an infusion or a bolus. 

## Mechanism of Action [^1]
- Norepinephrine stimulates **α1- and β1-adrenergic receptors**, causing vasoconstriction and maintains heart rate and contractility. 
- compared to [[Phenylephrine]], norepinephrine generally does not cause reflex bradycardia
- It causes significant increases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, with **minimal metabolic effects** (i.e., no hyperglycemia).

## Pharmacology [^2]
- **Onset:** ~ 1 minute
- **Duration:** ~2.5 minute half-life, requiring continuous infusion for sustained effect.
- **Elimination:** Primarily by reuptake with only a small portion metabolized and excreted in the urine.

| **[[Epinephrine]]**    | ++  | ++  | ++  | ++  |

## Indications [^1]
- **Hypotension**: First-line agent in treating hypotension during severe sepsis or septic shock.

## Dosage [^2]
*Norepinephrine is generally prepared as 64 mcg/mL in the ICU. 'Dilute' norepinephrine in the OR is generally 10 mcg/mL*
- **Continuous Infusion:**  wide variety of dosing
	- Low Dose: 0 - 0.1 mcg/kg/min
	- Medium Dose: 0.1-0.3 mcg/kg/min
	- High Dose: > 0.3 mcg/kg/min
- **Bolus Dose:** 10 mcg IV push
  - Long durations of infusions should be delivered via **central venous access** due to the risk of extravasation and tissue necrosis.
  - Short infusions (up to ~6 hours in sepsis) can be delivered through peripheral catheters. Dilute solutions (< 20 mcg/mL have been observed to be safe in peripheral catheters)

## Complications [^1]
- **Tachycardia and Arrhythmias:** While less arrhythmogenic than epinephrine, norepinephrine can still cause tachycardia, especially at higher doses.
- **End-Organ Ischemia:** Excessive vasoconstriction may lead to renal, splanchnic, and peripheral ischemia, potentially resulting in organ failure 
- **Extravasation Injury:** Extravasation of norepinephrine can lead to tissue necrosis.

## Clinical Pearls [^1]
- **Balanced Use in Coronary Artery Disease:** Norepinephrine is useful in increasing perfusion pressure, but caution must be taken to balance the resultant increase in afterload.
- **Splanchnic Blood Flow:** May improve splanchnic perfusion in hypotensive patients but can also reduce flow at high doses due to extreme vasoconstriction.
- **Vasoconstriction Risk:** Central venous administration is essential to avoid peripheral vasoconstriction and necrosis from extravasation.
