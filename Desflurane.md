## What is Desflurane?
- Volatile inhaled anesthetic agent used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Not often used for induction of anesthesia due to airway irritant properties. 
- It is synthetic, colourless and non-flammable
- Has a more rapid onset than other volatile agents such as sevoflurane and isoflurane while also having the shortest time to emergence.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1] [^2]
- There is no confirmed mechanism of action 
- Theories include that it activates GABA receptors and inhibits calcium channels or glutamate channels. 
- The volume expansion theory also details that the volatile anesthetic dissolves into the lipid cell membranes within the CNS and can distort sodium channels required for synaptic transmission. 
## Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2]
### Cardiovascular
- Peripheral vasodilatory effects leading to a decrease in blood pressure, occasionally there is also an increase in heart rate. 
- Can sometimes lead to activation of the sympathetic nervous system leading to hypertension and tachycardia when concentration is increased rapidly or high concentrations are used. 
### Respiratory
- More likely to elicit airway irritation symptoms such as coughing and laryngospasm compared to sevoflurane due to high pungency, therefore is not often used for induction of anesthesia.
### Other
-  Known to produce uterine relaxation which can be used in specific cases such as retained placenta but can be detrimental during other procedures such as a D&C. 

## Indications [^1] 
- Used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Not often used for induction of anesthesia due to airway irritation. 
- Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is used to compare the potencies between various volatile agents. 

## Complications [^1] [^2]
- Should not be used for anesthetic management in patients with known history of malignant hyperthermia or suspected susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. 
- If there is a dry or desiccated CO2 absorber used within the circle system then there can be production of carbon monoxide with desflurane, leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. 
- Increased incidence of post-operative agitation and excitement in pediatric patients.
