## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Facilitates the inhibitory actions of the neurotransmitter GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.
- Acts on glycine receptors to produce a muscle-relaxing effect.
- Has few systemic effects.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2] 
#### Cardiovascular 
- Minimally impacts blood pressure by reducing it through reduction of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. 
- Can have slight increase in heart rate. 
#### Respiratory
- When co-administered with respiratory depressants or administered intravenously, apnea or severe respiratory depression can occur. 
#### Central Nervous System
- Decreases cerebral metabolic rate
- Decreases cerebral blood flow
- Has anticonvulsant properties 

## Indications [^1]
#### Anesthetic Indications
- Co-induction agent for general anesthesia 
- Used for anxiolysis

#### Other Indications 
- Treatment of seizure disorders
- Treatment of alcohol withdrawal
- Treat seizures secondary to local anesthetic toxicity

## Dosage [^1]
- 0.01 - 0.1 mg/kg IV for sedation purposes
- 0.02 - 0.04 mg/kg for co-indcution purpases 
- Onset of action within 1 - 2 minutes
- Half-life of elimination = 1.5 - 2.5 hours

## Complications [^1] [^2]
- Can cause anterograde amnesia, drowsiness, ataxia, falls and confusion in elderly patients so should be used cautiously
- Hypotension and tachycardia if administered rapidly 
- QT prolongation, however this is a rare adverse effect
- Midazolam infusion syndrome is a rate side effect that may require ventilator support
- When administered in pregnant patients in their third trimester, it may cause neonatal withdrawal from benzodiazepines
